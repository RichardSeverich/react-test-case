# Analysis

## What we should do ?

* collect the requirements from the customer.
  - studying the current software they have.
  - user interviews
  - project scope
  - collect user requirements.
  - collect functional requirements.
  - collect system requirements.
* Identifies potential risks.
* Feasibility study. (Estudio de factibilidad.)
* Identifies fortes and weak points. (Identifica puntos fuertes y debiles)
* Identifies project viability. (Identifica la viabilidad del proyecto)
* build user histories.
* Define use cases.


## Requirements Analysis Document (RAD)

* The results of the requirements elicitation and the analysis activities are documented in the Requirements Analysis Document (RAD).
* This document completely describes the system in terms of functional and nonfunctional requirements and serves as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer.
* The RAD must be written in the language of the customer's domain of business/expertise.
* Under no circumstances should any "computerese" terminology creep into this document.

## Template of (RAD)
* 1. Introduction
  * 1.1 Purpose of the system
  * 1.2 Scope of the system
  * 1.3 Objectives and success criteria of the project
  * 1.4 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
  * 1.5 References
  * 1.6 Overview

The first section of the RAD is an Introduction. Its purpose is to provide a brief overview of the function of the system and the reasons for its development, its scope, and references to the development context (e.g., reference to the problem statement written by the client, references to existing systems, feasibility studies). The introduction also includes the objectives and success criteria of the project.

* 2. Current system

The second section, Current system, describes the current state of affairs. If the new system will replace an existing system, this section describes the functionality and the problems of the current system. Otherwise, this section describes how the tasks supported by the new system are accomplished now.


* 3. Proposed system

The third section documents the requirements elicitation and the analysis model of the new system.

* 3.1 Overview

The overview presents a functional overview of the system.

* 3.2 Functional requirements ("shall lists")

* 3.3 Nonfunctional requirements.

* 3.4 System models
  * 3.4.1 Scenarios
  * 3.4.2 Use case model
  * 3.4.3 Analysis object model
  * 3.4.4 Dynamic model (C4 model)
  * 3.4.5 User interface navigational paths and screen mock-ups.
